## AskGPT-3

This bot is designed to generate a comment using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model in response to a randomly selected post from the `r/askreddit` subreddit.

### Dependencies

This bot relies on two APIs: Reddit and OpenAI. Relevant documentation for both APIs can be found at the following links:
- [PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

To use this bot, you will need to obtain API credentials from both Reddit and OpenAI. Follow the instructions in the links above to obtain your credentials. 

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3. Open `askgpt3.py` in your preferred text editor.
4. Replace the placeholders in the `praw.Reddit()` function with your own Reddit API credentials.
5. Replace the placeholder for `openai.api_key` with your own OpenAI API key.
6. Set the `subreddit` variable to the name of the subreddit you want to search. By default, it is set to `'askreddit'`.
7. Save and close the file.

### Usage

Once you have set up the bot, you can run it from your command line by navigating to the directory containing `askgpt3.py` and running the command `python3 askgpt3.py`. 

When the script runs, it will select a random post from the `r/askreddit` subreddit that was posted in the last 24 hours. It will then generate a comment using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, using the post title and body as a prompt. Finally, it will post the generated comment as a reply to the selected post.

Note that the generated comment will include a disclaimer indicating that it was generated by a bot using OpenAI's language model. If you want to modify this disclaimer, you can edit the `disclaimer` variable in the script.
